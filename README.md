# PythonExamples
For demonstration purposes only

Once upon a time I was given this task:

Write a program using Python that would take as an input Excel file and read its contents. It would
then be able to do the following:

- Store the data from the file in a data structure of your choice suitable for further processing (for
example, saving it to the database or displaying it in table view on the screen).
- Remove all duplicates from the data set.
- Provide functionality to swap data between cells (for example, swap the values in cells A5 and
G7)
- Provide functionality to replace certain occurrences in the data set with arbitrary user’s choice (for
example, replace www.yahoo.com with <a href=”http://www.yahoo.com”>Yahoo</a>)

Expose those functionalities in user interface of your choice so that they could be interacted with
